Implementation of a wrapper component (User) and under it one more components Followers.

In the below data structure, each of the followers (which is a property of the users array) are themselves users and hence will have, id, name followers property themselves.

Hence, make a Followers component, which will have id and name props.

Final code should return each of the Users name and immediately below their followers name.

So, the above problem is  one of how data is passed from Parent to children in React.
